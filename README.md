# intro
This project creates a visually engaging animation inspired by Rabindranath Tagore's Stray Birds, using p5.js to display words in the shape of a bird. The animation places words from the text over a bird image, creating a dynamic scene where the bird “blinks” and repositions at random intervals.

# Features
